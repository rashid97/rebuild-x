# Write Your Own Git (Python)

## ðŸ›  A Minimal Git Implementation in Python

This project is a Python-based reimplementation of *Write Yourself a Git*, designed to help understand how Git works internally. By building Git from scratch, we explore version control fundamentals, including file storage, commits, branches, and merging.

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Initialize a Git repository (`git init`)

âœ… Store files as blobs (`git add`)

âœ… Create commits and track history (`git commit`)

âœ… Implement branches & merges (`git branch`, `git merge`)

âœ… Read commit history (`git log`)

âœ… Checkout different versions (`git checkout`)

## ðŸ“Œ Why Build Your Own Git?

- Learn SHA-1 hashing, data compression, and Gitâ€™s object model
- Understand branching, merging, and commit trees
- Gain low-level programming experience in Python

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rashid97/rebuild-x.git
cd wyag-python
python3 wyag.py init
